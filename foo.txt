Atlantic Cod

Gadus morhua
Most people associate Atlantic cod as the white fish found in popular fish and chips meals. Atlantic cod, a groundfish that hovers at the seafloor, grows fast and breeds at an early age. Many Atlantic cod stocks plummeted in the 1990s due to overfishing, and most rebuilding efforts have not yet succeeded. All fisheries of cod are red-graded or of concern except the North East Arctic fishery (ICES I, II).

Atlantic Halibut

Hippoglossus hippoglossus
Atlantic, common or white halibut is one of the largest of the flatfish. Atlantic halibut grow slowly and mature late, making it vulnerable to overfishing. They live on the ocean bottom in varied depths of water and, like a chameleon, take on protective coloration to match the sand, mud or gravel of its surroundings. Atlantic halibut has a long history of commercial exploitation due to being a very popular table fish in both North America and Europe as far back as the late 1800s.

Atlantic Salmon

Salmo salar
Atlantic salmon's popularity has increased dramatically in recent years, in large part because of growing consumer interest in eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids. Atlantic salmon is endangered in the wild, so virtually all Atlantic salmon sold commercially is farm raised.

SalmonWhere They Live
Wild Atlantic salmon are found swimming in the waters of the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into the Atlantic. Most farmed salmon comes from Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom and Chile. In the U.S., Maine and Washington also operate salmon farms.

How They're Farmed
Salmon are farmed in open net pens and cages in coastal areas or in freshwater lakes.

Causes For Concern
Stock Status
Wild Atlantic salmon is listed as endangered in the U.S., and is seriously depleted in its entire range in North America and Europe. In many rivers, Atlantic salmon is extinct.
Destructive Fishing Methods
The feed most commonly used for salmon farms consists of wild forage species. Salmon farming uses three pounds of wild fish to grow one pound of farmed salmon, which puts pressure on wild populations.
Habitat Impacts
Salmon farms may use pesticides and antibiotics to control outbreaks of disease among the fish. Chemicals and waste from most salmon farms are released directly into waters surrounding the farms. When consumers eat farmed salmon, they may also be eating residues from chemicals used in the farms.
Habitat Impacts
In some areas of the world where there is intensive salmon farming, coastal ecosystems have been altered resulting in declines of native species. Salmon farming endangers wild salmon populations. Parasites and diseases from farmed salmon can spread to wild fish swimming near the farms. When farmed salmon escape from salmon farms, they compete for food with wild fish, crowd natural spawning grounds and dilute the genetic pool of wild salmon species by interbreeding with them.
Fishing Communities Impact
In many areas, salmon farms have displaced local access to coastal resources or caused collapse of coastal food webs resulting in serious impacts local communities

Atlantic Sea Scallop

Placopecten magellanicus
Scallops, recognized for their beautiful outer shell, use a strong, circular muscle to clap their shells together, letting them "fly" through the water out of harm's way. It is this circular (abductor) muscle that is prized as seafood.

Bigeye Tuna

Thunnus obesus
A valuable tuna prized for its sashimi-quality flesh, bigeye is found throughout the world's oceans and the long-term ecosystem effects of removing large predators such as tuna are not fully understood. Bigeye tuna is sometimes referred to as ahi, as is yellowfin tuna.

Bluefin Tuna

Thunnus thynnus, Thunnus maccoyii, Thunnus orientalis
This fish is the largest species of tuna reaching lengths of up to ten feet long and weights of 1,500 pounds. Bluefin tuna are the world's most valuable fish for sushi because of its high oil content. An individual bluefin can be worth over $30,000.00 at the Tokyo fish auction. The high demand bluefin has taken its toll leaving severely depleted populations throughout its range. Bluefin also contains elevated levels of mercury and PCBs.

Chilean Sea Bass

Dissostichus eleginoides
Also called Patagonian toothfish, Chilean sea bass is one of the most sought-after fish in the world. The Chileans were the first to market toothfish commercially in the U.S., earning it the name Chilean sea bass, although it is really not a bass and it is not always caught in Chilean waters. The U.S. is the largest market for Chilean sea bass, followed by Japan and China. The once-obscure fish became a culinary celebrity during the 1990s however fish populations cannot keep up with the demand. Unless people stop eating Chilean sea bass, it may be commercially extinct within five years.

Chilean Sea BassWhere They Live
Chilean sea bass is a deep-water species caught in southern ocean waters near and around Antarctica.

How They're Caught
Chilean sea bass are caught using hooks attached to longlines that are strung behind fishing boats. Some Chilean sea bass is caught in waters off the coast of Chile, then iced and shipped to the U.S. fresh. However, the majority of Chilean sea bass is harvested in distant waters of Antarctica, frozen onboard factory vessels, and shipped several weeks to several months later. Both fresh and frozen Chilean sea bass are available for consumption in the U.S.

Causes For Concern
Stock Status
Chilean sea bass stocks are seriously overfished and depleted. Chilean sea bass is a long-lived, slow growing fish that does not reach maturity until at least 10 years of age, making the species very vulnerable to overfishing.
Destructive Fishing Methods
The baited hooks of the long-lines used to catch Chilean sea bass attract sea birds, including endangered species such as petrels and albatrosses. The birds get caught on the hooks, and then are dragged underwater and drown. Sharks, skates, and rays are also caught incidentally and killed in this fishery.
Habitat Impacts
Chilean sea bass is a major predator, and the cascading effects on the ecosystem as a result of removing this species have not been determined.
Pirate Fishing
Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing is a major issue in the fishery, and makes effective management very difficult. In 2000, more than 16,000 tons of Chilean sea bass were legally harvested in the Antarctic management area. Estimates vary, but there may be up to twice that amount taken illegally. Some estimate that pirate fishing takes up to 80% of the catch.

Greenland Halibut

Reinhardtius hippoglossoides
The Greenland halibut is a strange-looking, but popular seafood that lives in the deep, cold waters of the north Pacific and north Atlantic oceans. The halibut's left eye is positioned on its forehead, giving it an appearance of a cyclops when looking straight at it. Greenland halibut are long-lived, slow growing and mature late, making it very vulnerable to overfishing.

Grouper

Epinephelus morio
There are more than 85 species of grouper found worldwide. Groupers are relatively long-lived (up to 40 years) and reproduce for only a short period of time, making them especially vulnerable to overfishing.

//
 
Hoki

Macruronus novaezelandiae
Hoki is a white fish and has different regional names such as blue hake, blue grenadier, and whiptail. In the U.S., hoki is mostly used in restaurants, though it's seldom noted on menus. Fast-food chains like hoki for its versatility and interchange it with pollock or cod. Most Americans have no clue that hoki is often what they're eating in fried-fish sandwiches and fish and chips.

//
 
Monkfish

Lophius americanus
This bottom fish was at one time discarded when caught incidentally in the Atlantic cod and scallop fisheries, but as these other fisheries declined, monkfish began to be marketed as gourmet fare. High demand encouraged heavy fishing, and populations became overfished. Thankfully, recent changes in management and consumer demand have helped monkfish populations to recover, but the bottom trawls that are used to catch monkfish still wreak havoc on our oceans.

Ocean Quahog

Arctica islandica
Ocean quahogs, a clam, are among the longest lived, slowest growing marine organisms in the world. Ocean quahogs off Southern New England, in the mid-Atlantic Bight and on Georges Bank can live over 200 years.

Orange Roughy

Hoplostethus atlanticus
Also called the slimehead, deep sea perch or red roughy, the orange roughy is a sedentary fish that dwells in deep cold waters. A slow-growing, late-maturing fish, orange roughy is one of the longest-living fish (up to 149 years) in the sea. In the U.S., orange roughy is sold skinned and filleted, fresh or frozen. In restaurants they are seen as a delicacy.

//
 
Pollock

Theragra chalcogramma
Pollock are considered one of the most important fish resources in the world with 2.2 million tons caught each year valued $2 billion dollars worth of fish. Pollock serve as important prey for many marine mammals and are also consumed by humans in many forms -- most commonly as fish sticks or breaded fish fillets.

//
 
Redfish

Sebastes marinus, Sebastes fasciatus, Sebastes mentella
Redfish is a slow-growing, deepwater fish with bright-red or orange-red coloring. They are called redfish in New England and eastern Canada and should not be confused with redfish from the Gulf of Mexico, which are different. Ocean perch is a leading retail product in the Midwest, where the name "perch" is an easy sell because of its freshwater connotation.

Red Snapper

Lutjanus campechanus
Red snapper are a prized seafood and are caught commercially, as well as recreationally. They are a slow growing species that mature late. Many are caught before they have had a chance to reproduce.

Mislabeling of red snapper for consumers is a big problem with this fish. Genetic studies have shown that many fish sold as red snapper in the U.S. are not actually red snapper, but other species.
